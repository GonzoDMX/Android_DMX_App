# Android_DMX_App
An Android-based DMX Lighting Controller

## <b>ESP32 Wifi Access Point to DMX Widget:</b>
In order to actually control DMX based lights the android application communicates with an ESP32 Dev board.
The schematic used can be viewed with KiCad and the code was written with Arduino IDE using a slightly modified ESP32 core and the LXESP32DMX Library available here: https://github.com/claudeheintz/LXESP32DMX
